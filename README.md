# spotify-react
You want to play music from spotify on your website, but don't want to build the actual player? Worry not

Check out my GH-Pages https://addi-g998.github.io/spotify-react/# (Since the API is currently in Developer mode only a few selected people can actually use the music feature)

Due to complexity i'm not gonna explain how to connect to the API.
